553,Acid sulfate soils series,https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/acid-sulfate-soils-series,This series contains acid sulfate soils information for Queensland. Mapping is available for a number of locations at scales suitable for land use planning.,Maps and geospatial; Sciences;,,Environment and Science,opendata@des.qld.gov.au,8/01/2013,Acid sulfate soils of the Narrows area of Central Queensland - CQAN,"This dataset is an acid sulfate soils map for The Narrows area, near Gladstone. It shows the presence of, type of, and average depth to acid sulfate soil layers in polygons interpreted as relatively homogenous acid sulfate environments. A combination of soils description, laboratory testing, elevation and geology data, and API (airphoto interpretation) was used to construct the map.This mapping is at a nominal scale of 1:50,000 and is restricted to coastal areas below 5m AHD. However, the effective scale of each map polygon varies based on the number of soil description sites within it. This map may be used for strategic land use planning. It is also appropriate for a very general preliminary assessment of acid sulfate hazard at property scale. However, it is not sufficiently detailed for intensive development planning.",Esri File Geodatabase,1 MiB,,https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/acid-sulfate-soils-series/resource/2f0a6818-23e3-4c30-9f96-8450174ffb32,"http://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/catalogue/custom/search.page?q=""Acid sulfate soils of the Narrows area of Central Queensland - CQAN""",20/02/2020,undefined,undefined,Dataset,SOILS,OFFICIAL,Kelly Bryant,Department of Environment and Science,completed

**Surface nutrient samples:** APHA (1998) Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services photochemical methods using a flow injection analyser (FIA). A laboratory method change in 1997 improved the Kjeldahl digestion of samples resulting in a lower Organic Nitrogen detection limit. In 1999, a change in the laboratory instrument has led to slightly lower and more stable Nitrogen Oxides and Filterable Reactive Phosphorus results. A 1999 change replaced the higher temperature and stronger acid concentration Kjeldahl digestion with Persulphate Oxidation digestion which in some circumstances will extract less P from particulates with the effect of an apparent small reduction in Total Phosphorus results. These changes are mostly apparent at low levels and the differences lie within the precision range of the method.

The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on an automated decision tree classification technique applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat 5 TM imagery for the period 1986-2010. The product has a nominal accuracy of 85%. The field data used to calibrate the imagery/FPC relationship was mostly collected over the period 1996-1999. Additional corrections were also applied to the final product to remove errors due to topographic effects, cloud, cloud shadow, water, cropping, regrowth and wooded vegetation clearing.

While some land cover change may be detected in the FPC processing, this product is not designed to generate clearing layers, and cannot be used to assess clearing or be compared with previous years for change monitoring.

The Remote Sensing Centre FPC mapping is based on regression models applied to dry season (May to October) Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM  and Landsat-8 OLI imagery for the period 1988-2014. An annual woody spectral index image is created for each year using a multiple regression model trained from field data collected mostly over the period 1996-1999.

The estimated foliage projective cover is the prediction at the date of the selected dry season image for 2014. Where this deviates significantly from the woody spectral index for that date, further tests are undertaken before this estimate is accepted. In some cases, the final estimate is the woody spectral index value rather than the robust regressionprediction.

There are a number of functions that retrieve species names, profiles, notes, statuses, images, species survey locations and project information.  

Please see [https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species/) for more information on using the API functions.  

Data can be retrieved in 3 different formats by adding the format variable to the end of the url (e.g. **&f=xml**).  The default format is json if the **f** (format) variable is omitted.  
E.g.  
- **JSON:** https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species/?op=getkingdomnames&f=json  
- **XML:** https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species/?op=getkingdomnames&f=xml  
- **CSV:** https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species/?op=getkingdomnames&f=csv  
  
When spatial locations are returned, GeoJSON or KML will be used when requesting the json and xml formats.  

[Species profile search](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species-search/) can be used to locate species information (by name or a taxonomy search). It uses the Get species by ID function to display species profiles with images and maps and uses the Get surveys by species function for downloading data.

[Biomaps](http://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/biomaps/) provides a map interface to display the WildNet records approved for publication  with other spatial layers (such as cadastre, protected areas, vegetation and biodiversity value mapping). A range of WildNet reports based on all WildNet records and other environmental reports can be requested for properties and drawn areas etc.

[WetlandMaps](https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/wetlandmaps/) provides a map interface to display the data derived from Get sites, Get surveys and Species search functions with other spatial layers (such as protected areas and wetland mapping).

The [Queensland Globe](https://qldglobe.information.qld.gov.au/) can be used to access WildNet records approved release and access summarised WildNet data in 10x10km grids.  

Other [WildNet products](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset?q=wildnet) are made available via the Queensland Government Open Data Portal.

The resources listed below are the service endpoints for each of the operations (or functions) available.  
  
**Available variables**  
**f**: Format - Setting the 'f' variable will determine the format of the response.  There are 4 possible options; json, xml, kml and csv.  Json is the default if 'f' is not set.  If the output is spatial, GeoJson will be return for 'f=json' and KML will be returned for 'f=xml' or 'f=kml'.
